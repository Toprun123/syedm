Hi, there! I'm Syed, a student and tech enthusiast—I love anything programming-related: web dev, TUI apps, bash scripts, Linux ricing—literally anything. I'm a self-taught coder; I started off with batch from an old school book in 5th grade, then moved on to Arduino (C++) in 6th grade when my father got me a new set over vacation, sparking a new phase of my life that hasn't ended. Discovering Linux was a game changer—now I just can't stop spending hours trying out new distros, ricing them, and playing sysadmin until I get bored and move on to the next one. You'll mostly find me building websites in RoR, TUI apps in Go, or writing bash scripts for my new Linux setup. But if not, you'll find me enjoying some downtime with my favorite hobbies. I love reading novels—murder mysteries and detective fiction are my go-to genres (with Agatha Christie, Louis Sachar, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle among my favorites). I could play Minesweeper for hours, and I often pass the time watching math and particle physics videos on YouTube. I'm also into languages in general; although my native language is Urdu, I can fluently read, write, and speak English and Hindi as I learned them in school. I've learned some Arabic at school, but I'm not fluent yet. I'm currently learning Turkish as a hobby online and from books, and I've gotten pretty good at it.
